JSLearning - JavaScript Learning Exercises

* Many snippets authored by Scott Sanbar as I use various learning resources
* Many more authored by various people in the community
* Intended to capture many good coding practices and key concepts in JavaScript

JavaScript is a very important front line vehicle for accessing APIs exposed by
the Domain Object Model (DOM) in such environments as Web Browsers and Servers.

JavaScript is a scripting language that includes reflection and very loose typing
to facilitate ease of use for a wide audience of script writers.

JavaScript is not Java or an offshoot of Java, but has syntax elements similar to
Java and C/C++ to facilitate an easier learning curve for those already familiar
with those computer languages.
