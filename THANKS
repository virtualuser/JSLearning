FireFly has been very instrumental in helping me learn JavaScript properly,
along with man others in the irc.freenode.net ##javascript channel.

Most especially, he and others like (nicks) Mortchek and Sorella helped me
get a better handle on a "somewhat pure", efficient way to accomplish
prototypal inheritance in JavaScript which I will be employing in place
of the code that was given me by ApOgEE below.  Data hiding is sacrificed for
for reducing code duplication and better alignment with intended design
patterns.  I believe this is a sound tradeoff at this time.

The deep insights they have given me are much appreciated, and resulted in
my ability to formulate an "inheritance factory" function that is both simple
and powerful.  A better version called "extend" by FireFly is what I may
actually be using.  It depends on performance of the two methods.

ApOgEE volunteered to take my MathLibrary.js module and rewrite it using
the proper form for my OOP object.  I then was able to successfully model
all my other library and project OOP objects after his example.
